"""
This is a script that does some time series analysis on a single voxel 
for subject 1. It relies heavily on the statsmodels module, and since 
there aren't really any built-in functions at this time, there is no 
corresponding file in the functions or tests directories. If writing 
additional functions becomes necessary, I will implement and test them 
as needed.
