% tex file for time series
\par \indent Cohen's paper \cite{CohenSelfControl} discusses analyzing the 
data with time series using FILM (FMRIBs Improved Linear Model). While we are 
not familiar with the FILM method, we did try modeling individual voxels in 
the framework of an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) process. 
We focused only on a single voxel from the first subject, but the method 
could easily be extended to additional or aggregate voxels. Let $\{Y_t\}$ be 
a single volume's value at time $t$ and assume that the $d$th difference 
$W_t = \nabla^d Y_t$ is weakly stationary, defined to be when $W_t$ has a 
constant mean function and autocovariance dependent only on lag $k$ and not 
time $t$. Then we can try to model $W_t$ as a linear combination of $p$ 
autoregressive terms (or the number of most recent values to include) and $q$ 
moving average terms (the number of lags to include for the white noise error 
terms): 
$$W_t = \phi_1 W_{t-1} + \phi_2 W_{t-2} + ... + \phi_p W_{t-p} + e_t - 
\theta_1 e_{t-1} - \theta_2 e_{t-2} - ... - \theta_q e_{t-q}.$$

\par White noise is defined as a sequence of independent, identically 
distributed random variables. In order to fit an ARIMA process, the three 
orders $p$, $d$, and $q$ must be first be specified, and the the associated 
coefficients estimated. We used a combination of visual inspection and 
quantitative methods to specify the ARIMA orders, and then used the maximum 
likelihood method to estimate parameters.
